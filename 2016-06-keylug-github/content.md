# Git - A Primer

???
Here we'll cover a history of Git
and where it fits into the scheme of version control.

---

# FOSS VCS history

--
* rcs (1982)
--

* cvs (1990)
--

* svn (2000)
--

* bzr (2005) (distributed)
--

* hg (2005) (distributed)
--

* git (2005) (distributed)

--

and a host of others along the way

--

* 2005 was apparently a very good year
--

* Dishonorable mentions: ClearCase, Visual SourceSafe

---

# Distributed VCS (DVCS)

### What makes the distributed concept so powerful?

* Most operations are local to your machine<br>
  (i.e., OMG FAST)
* Incentivizes good development practices
  (short lived, feature branches)
* Resilient to data loss

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ (mostly a nice side effect)

# That's enough backstory
