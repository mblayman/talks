> On our monolith we needed roughly 150 servers to power the more intensive
portions of BR. Following our move to Elixir we're now able to power those
same functions on five servers and we're probably overprovisioned.
We could probably get away with it on two

* No caching
* No autoscaling and 8x load (bottlenecked at db)

Bogdan/Bj√∂rn's Erlang Abstract Machine

## Erlang?<br>I thought this was about Elixir.

???

It is. Elixir is a new language that compiles to the BEAM.
It's the cool younger sibling of Erlang.

## How is the BEAM so magical?

--

* How do I write "concurrent" code?
--

* I wrote a threaded program before and wanted to gouge my eyes out.

???

Is writing Elixir going to make me hate everyone and everything?

--

### Key elements

* Functional Programming
???

Code has defined inputs and outputs with minimal side effects

--

* Actor Model

???

* Threaded model: communicate by sharing state (hence locks)
* Actor model: share state by communicating
